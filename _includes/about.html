          <h5>Intro to Lacework - Shaelyn Shawl</h5>
          <p>
            In this class we will be exploring the Shaelyn Shawl pattern
            by Leila Raabe. This top-down, centre-out shawl features
            alternating lace and stocking stitch panels for an elegant,
            versatile accessory. Along with basic lace stitches, students
            will learn the garter tab cast-on, how to read both written
            and charted lace instructions, how to prevent and correct
            common mistakes, as well as finishing techniques for making
            the most of your lace knitting.

          <p>
            This class is for confident beginner knitters. Students
            should already be comfortable casting on and familiar with
            both knit and purl stitches.

          <p>
            Socks aren't as scary as you think. If you can knit and purl
            then you can make socks. Chunky socks work up faster so you
            can see your sock finished sooner.
